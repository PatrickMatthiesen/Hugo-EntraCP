## Main improvements

* A new, greater design.
* The SharePoint solution type was changed to `Application` (instead of `Web Front End`), which makes administrative operations (install / update / delete) much easier and safer by design.
* A single location to configure the proxy for all the SharePoint processes / servers in the farm.
* Revisited NuGet dependencies, upgraded to their latest versions.

## Overview of the changes

* A new solution name: EntraCP.wsp
* A new claims provider: EntraCP
* No compatibility with AzureCP
* The minimum SharePoint version required is 2016
* The minimum .NET Framework required is 4.8
* It no longer works on SharePoint 2013
 
## Why those changes

Simply put, the weight of legacy: AzureCP had too many early design mistakes, that I could not fix without making breaking changes that created significant risks when updating it. So, I always privileged the most secure approach.

Nevertheless, a few months ago I decided to rewrite the code entirely, knowing it would have to be a completely new, renamed claims provider, with no compatibility with AzureCP.

In the middle of this work, Microsoft [renamed Azure Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/new-name), which made a nice timing with my work, and a new, easy name to pick up.
